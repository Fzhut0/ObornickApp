## What is ObornickApp?
https://obornickapp.fly.dev/

ObornickApp was created as a platform for different small tools. Since it's used by me and my closest ones all features are kinda customized towards specific usages but nevertheless anyone can register and use all the tools.


### Recipe Module
First module is recipe module which I created to store my cooking recipes with my own changes to the recipes but in convenient digital way. 
Along that there is a feature where recipe ingredients are sent through facebook as a message so I can have sort of shopping list. As far as Meta API allows it, messages are sent from facebook fanpage to user which has conversation with fanpage.
As for now account can be manually connected with that module but in the future I'd like to fully automate connecting ObornickApp account with sending messages to owners facebook account.

### Link manager
Second module is link manager where user can create categories, subcategores and add links. All of that can have it's own custom names and subcategories can be added recursively.
Links can also be sent as a message in a same way as recipe ingredients.
